## About Me

<img id="profile" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thescriptninja/thescriptninja.github.io/master/img/profilepic.jpg" alt="Me" title="This is me" width="200" height="200" align="right"/>

Hi! I am Parth Paradkar. I am a third year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur (remotely these days, unfortunately). I love building things, software especially. I am a Python fan with a love for open source software. I am always curious about new technologies and their applications.

I am passionate about discovering new music and am currently hooked to Led Zepellin, The Doors, The War on Drugs and Blackstratblues.
My DMs are always open to discussions about programming, books, music, movies, psychology and philosophy.

## What I am doing these days
I am currently exploring the intersection between software and music and trying to build projects that make music discovery and sharing better.
I am learning more about Operating Systems and the Go programming language.

## Currently reading

_Fooled by Randomness_ by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
