## _Greetings!_

Welcome to my blog, or as I like to think of it - my thought repo. Here you can find the footprints of the wanderings of my thoughts, useful stuff I have learnt and maybe some random rants about random things.


## About Me

<img id="profile" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thescriptninja/thescriptninja.github.io/master/img/profilepic.jpg" alt="Me" title="This is me" width="200" height="200" align="right"/>

My name is Parth Paradkar. I am a second year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I am in love with building things, software especially. I am Python fan with a love for open source software. I am excited about learning about new technologies and their applications.

I am a sworn bibliophile. I love to read novels and thrillers, but I am starting to enjoy non-fiction books these days. I am attempting to write short stories and poetry myself too :) 

I am passionate about discovering new music and am currently hooked to Queen, Led Zepellin and The Doors.
My DMs are always open to discussions about programming, books, music, movies, psychology and philosophy. Feel free to hit me up anytime :D

## Currently reading

_A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin_
