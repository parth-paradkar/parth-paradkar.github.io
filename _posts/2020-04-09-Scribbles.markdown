## Spoils of a silent war. 
---

 

We are in love with rebellion 

With the screaming tears of anger, 

With the shrill cry of defiance, 

With freedom, 

With love.


--- 

 

The game is long 

A beautiful farce, 

Brimming with emptiness. 


--- 

 

Thinking of what could have been, 

In hell I brood, 

If I had not reached out for heaven. 


---


Yet again, I spread my wings, 

Look to the sky, knowing my fate to fall. 

But I shall crash as a laughing inferno, 

If I am to crash at all.

If there was ever a parallel universe in which I didn't know you, 

I would jump a hundred wormholes 

To tell myself about you.
