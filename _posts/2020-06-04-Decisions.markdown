## Dreams

During my JEE preparation days, I often fantasized of the independence that lay before me, regardless of where I went after it was over. When it became clear I was to come to KGP, the excitement multiplied manifold as I started imagining the life that lay before me. Most of this excitement lay in the anticipation of making my decisions and choices by myself. 

I had always been shielded by my parents in making big decisions. They gave me the independence I wanted, but I was always saved from bad decisions and the bad consequences of those decisions by the wisdom and protection that they offered and often imposed :stuck_out_tongue: . I always had a parachute, a safety harness , so to speak. However, that, in itself became an impedance to the true freedom that I yearned. I didn't want to be answerable to anyone, I wanted to be autonomous.



## Reality

Spending time in college gave me a lot of perspective on this which came as a slightly painful eye-opener that was enough to pull me out of my idealistic fantasies. Exercising my new-found freedom wasn't neither as glamorous or liberating as I had thought it to be. Choices have consequences and facing them is a part of the game (surprise, surprise!). Transferring the blame or responsibility for those choices was no more an option. As college life started I often found myself making bad choices and having to face the consequences out of obligation.



## The Attempt

These decisions, in retrospect, weren't life changing nor had any long-term significance. But it made me think of all the things that I would have to decide in the future that actually _would_ matter. After all,  decisions would shape the time-line life, in whatever little way. They would be the checkpoints in the route towards wherever the experience of life leads. 

The hardest part for me while making choices at a point in time, was to assess the upsides and downsides in real time when situations presented themselves to me and I had to come to a conclusion. I found it hard to gain complete view of the circumstances in an objective way.

I decided to dig a bit further and look at what is happening behind the scenes at these points in time and possibly speculate if I can respond any better at such times.



## The Reflection

There are times when an opportunity or choice presents itself and a decision has to be made. To state some somewhat trivial examples- project proposals, Hackathon problem statements, internship applications.

This is applies even to establishing personal relationships and who deciding whom to associate and spend time with. We are presented with very subtle choices in this regard- to go for a snack or to make up an excuse not to; to catch their glance and say 'Hi' or to walk away, ignoring it.

Recently, one of my friends asked me if I was interested to participate in a project he was working on. I felt like it would be a good project to be involved in. Soon after I got into it and saw the code base, I instantly grew disinterested. Neither was it stimulating enough for me nor did I think I was doing something novel. This got me thinking - could I have assessed the situation better?



## _Thinking_ and _Feeling_

Note the use of _think_ and _feel_. Before committing, it was all emotions, an internal voice talking which was completely supportive before I agreed to work. I experienced something similar when I joined an organization (to keep cell/society abstract :stuck_out_tongue: ) out of peer pressure. I _felt_ like it was a great thing to be a part of. It was during my initial months at college, everything _felt_ new and exciting. Anything remotely interesting not being done felt like a missed opportunity to me. It later led to disinterestedness, anxiety and a sense of regret of having wasted precious time after I had finally quit.



## Perception

One thing that I starkly remember from my psychology course is that perception is influenced so much more by our emotions and  our personality than we think. We, ironically enough, _feel_ we are being rational at such times, when we are actually being lured by preconceived notions and buried beliefs that rarely come to the surface. There is such little space for rational thought that taking a gut decision remains as the only option. 

Perhaps this is why choices and decisions make such a good judge of character, because they reveal so much of what is really lurking underneath the glossy surface that a person shows to the world.

I have realized that the present state of mind and past experiences and prejudices have an inordinately large role to play in making decisions. They get us dangerously close to, if not to the point of, performing rash and emotional actions that are irrational and near enough stupid in hindsight. Anger, anxiety and even happiness and joy for that matter play huge roles in shaping our perception of how things are. They are our tinted glasses to see stone-cold facts, coloring perceptions and thereby influencing seemingly-rational decisions. 

Are these tinted glasses necessarily evil or counter-productive, though? They are, after all, our natural responses to events and happenings in our environment. They are, as anthropologists and psychologists say, stemmed deep in our subconscious, the part of ourselves that is stuck in the cave-man days, trying to survive in the wild. The so-called 'gut feeling' is theorized to be primordial and designed for maximizing our chances of survival. Is mistrusting these natural defense mechanisms such a good thing? I wonder.

## Solution?

How do we escape this tendency of ours? Can we at all be completely neutral and objective while making possibly life-changing decisions?

Perhaps it will help if one is conscious and mindful of the his or her present state of mind. Maybe the solution lies not in escaping our inner voices, but letting them calm down to some extent and looking at the metaphorical depth of reality when the waters of the mind calm down. People often use the phrase 'sleep on it' or the more obvious 'think about it' after making important personal or professional proposals. Perhaps the time given to stew the perception helps to eventually see things rationally. Whenever possible, it is wise to take some time out, actually take a deep breath and look at all the possible outcomes and effects of the decision in question. This seems really obvious, it's strange how I realized this this late.

Talking and advice is also crucial. Talking with people who have been through similar scenarios, and talking to people who have faced life in general proves to be invaluable. I have slowly learned this after speaking and engaging with college seniors, people working in the industry and even relatives. I have learned to get over the stigma of reaching out to people, that I naturally have as an introvert. Making the suggestions and advice a part of the decision-making process can be extremely helpful, if only one keeps in mind the uniqueness of each person's circumstances. 

But after all is thought out, planned out, talked out, run through and contemplated a million times, and things don't work anyways, I'll be forced to call upon the immortal words of Frank Sinatra- ["That's Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlPtaPxXfc)
